# Claw

A high-level programming language that compiles to [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)*.

**Currently in very early development.** See
[doc/core-0.1.0.md](https://github.com/Arc-blroth/claw-lang/blob/master/doc/core-0.1.0.md)
and [doc/brainstorming.md](https://github.com/Arc-blroth/claw-lang/blob/master/doc/brainstorming.md)
for a rough outline of what features are planned. Expect all changes to be breaking.
